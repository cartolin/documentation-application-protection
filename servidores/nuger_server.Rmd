## Overview

NuGet.Server is a package provided by the .NET Foundation that creates an ASP.NET application capable of hosting a package feed on any server running IIS. Essentially, NuGet.Server exposes a folder on the server through HTTP(S) using OData. It's straightforward to set up and ideal for simple scenarios.

## Getting Started

To create and deploy an ASP.NET Web application using NuGet.Server, follow these steps:

### Create an empty ASP.NET Web application

1. In Visual Studio, select **File > New > Project**.
2. Search for **ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)** and select the matching template for C#.
3. Set the Framework to ".NET Framework 4.6".
4. Choose the **Empty** template.

### Adding NuGet.Server package

1. Right-click on the project, select **Manage NuGet Packages**.
2. Switch to the **Browse** tab, search for **NuGet.Server**, and install the latest version (ensure compatibility with .NET Framework 4.6).

### Configuration and Deployment

1. **Configure the Packages folder**: NuGet.Server automatically creates a Packages folder in your application and sets up necessary configurations in `web.config`.
   
   - Make sure to inspect `web.config` after installation to avoid duplicate elements that may cause issues.

2. **Run locally**: Debug the project in Visual Studio (`Debug > Start Without Debugging` or `Ctrl+F5`). Verify the home page for package feed URLs.

3. **Deployment**: Once tested locally, deploy the application to your desired server.

### Example URL after deployment

Once deployed to `http://<domain>`, the package source URL will be `http://<domain>/nuget`. [Visited repository](https://github.com/cartolin/Nuget-Server)
